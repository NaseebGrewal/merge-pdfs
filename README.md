# merge-pdfs

A simple, user-friendly Flask application for merging multiple PDF files into a single PDF.

## Project Overview

This project allows users to upload several PDF files through a web interface, merges them using [PyPDF2](https://pypi.org/project/PyPDF2/), and returns the merged PDF for download. The application is containerized using a [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) and is built with simplicity and ease-of-use in mind.

## Repository Structure

- **app.py** - The main Flask application that sets up web routes and handles the merging logic using [PyPDF2](https://pypi.org/project/PyPDF2/).
- **templates/index.html** - The HTML template that renders the form for uploading PDFs.
- **Dockerfile** - The Docker configuration file for containerizing the application.
- **requirements.txt** - Lists the Python dependencies: Flask and PyPDF2.
- **LICENSE** - The project is released under the MIT License.
- **.gitignore** - Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git.
- **notebooks/** - Contains notebook files for experiments or testing (e.g., [notebooks/test.ipynb](notebooks/test.ipynb)).

    ```
    The application will be accessible at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

## Application Details

### Merging PDFs

The core merging functionality is implemented in the `merge_pdfs` function within [app.py](http://_vscodecontentref_/1). This function:
- Receives a list of uploaded PDF files.
- Uses [PyPDF2](https://pypi.org/project/PyPDF2/) to read and combine each page of every file.
- Writes the merged content to a temporary file and returns it for download.

### Web Interface

The user interface is defined in [index.html](http://_vscodecontentref_/2), which uses Bootstrap for styling. It includes:
- A file upload form that allows selecting multiple PDF files.
- A text input to optionally specify the output filename.
- A submit button that triggers the merging process.

### Error Handling

If any file cannot be processed, the application will display an error message using Flaskâ€™s flash messaging system. For more details, check out how errors are caught in the `merge_pdfs` function.
